# Contributing Guide

👋 Thanks for contributing! (Even if it’s just me right now…)

## Workflow
1. Create an issue before major changes (Bug 🐞, Feature ✨, Chore 🛠️).
2. Branch from `main` with a short, descriptive name.
3. Open a Pull Request using the PR template.

## Semantic Commits
Follow [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org):
- `feat:` – a new feature
- `fix:` – a bug fix
- `chore:` – build, CI, tooling
- `docs:` – documentation only
- `refactor:` – code improvement
- `test:` – adding or updating tests

Example:


## Continuous Integration
- Every PR triggers CI (tests + lint).
- Only merge if CI is green.

## Code Style
- Keep code clean and documented.
- Small commits > big commits.
